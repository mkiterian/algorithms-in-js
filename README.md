Some algorithms implemented in javascript

## Search Algorithms

### Linear search
In a worst case scenario, this has a time complexity of *O(n)*

### Binary search
Works on sorted data
Uses a divide and conquer approach
In a worst case scenario, this has a time complexity of *O(Log n)*

## Sorting Algorithms
### Bubble Sort
Has a worst case time complexity of O(n^2)

### Insertion Sort
Has a worst case time complexity of O(n^2)
Performs well if the data is almost sorted
Also performs well when data is streaming in one at a time

## Selection Sort
Has a worst case time complexity of O(n^2)
